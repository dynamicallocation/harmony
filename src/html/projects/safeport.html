        <h2>SafePort</h2><br/>
        <p><i>SafePort</i> is a group project that I worked on during my third year at Loyola University for my Software Engineering course.  The link to its repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/ehoffman5/SafePort" class="hyperlink" target="_blank">here</a>.  For this project, our professor allowed us to choose any program or app that we would like to make.  My group and I had never worked with cybersecurity before but found it to be an interesting and important subject, so we decided to dip our feet into understanding it.  We researched various tools and decided on making a GUI-based port scanner called <i>SafePort</i>.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Port scanners are an important tool for maintaining device security, but they are also quite difficult to understand for inexperienced users.  <i>SafePort</i>'s purpose was to make this subject accessible by packaging the concept into a sleek, modern, easy-to-use desktop application.  As opposed to less user-friendly port scanners like ZenMap, our app would make it easy for users to scan their device with a single click.  Its GUI would be specifically designed to make scanning as simple as possible.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>For this project, I was tasked with designing and implementing the user interface and connecting it to the back-end of the application.  Every week, my teammates and I met with our TA during office hours to get help and advice to ensure that our app was the best product that it could be.  We worked tirelessly to finish this project before its deadline, and our hard work paid off.  After our class presentation, we decided to present our project in front of the entire Loyola University CS Department during its end-of-semester competition - and we had the honor of winning.
